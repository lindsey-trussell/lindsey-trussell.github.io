            My therapist said that I should start journaling. I figured that writing on the internet is close enough to writing everything in a book, so welcome to my ‘journal.’

                I started listening to my old tapes and records this morning. I’m trying to get back to normal again, I think. I was listening to one of my mixtapes from highschool, you know, as a way to cope. It was chalk full of that 90s riot grrrl I used to listen to. Raincoats, Bikini Kill, Veruca Salt, etc. All of that shit my mom showed me when I was younger. It was nice, listening to angry music like that. It made me feel something other than sad.<br>
                That was another thing my therapist said, that I should try and do things that make me happy. She thinks it's a good way for me to get out of this ‘funk’ as she calls it. I think it just makes me feel worse. I think the angry music helps, it makes me feel like I’m finally moving on. She says that anger is natural, and it’s all a part of how I ‘heal.’ Her saying that just makes me more angry.<br>
                When I was flipping through my tapes, there was this weird one that stuck out. It looked new, but it didn’t look like a mixtape. It just had ‘monomania’ scribbled on the side. I recognised the handwriting, of course, and lost my breath for a second. Isn’t that pathetic? Shitty handwriting can make me double over. So much for moving on. I couldn’t help myself from listening, though. <br>
                The music on the tape was weird, too. It was an entire album. It was some guy whining over these distorted synth and guitar tracks. Some of them were ten or fifteen minutes long! Imagine how much time it takes to write a fifteen minute song, let alone make sure it actually sounds good. Maybe that’s why I’m creeped out by it. The lyrics were mean, too. It was a breakup album, to make matters worse. I mean, it wasn’t his voice, so I know he didn’t leave some depressing demo tape in my apartment, but I don’t know why he would have listened to something like that. Was he listening to breakup albums, even before? I actually don’t want to think about that.<br>
                Back to the tape. Half of the lyrics were just screaming, not even words, just la la la, or woaaah woaaah woaaah. There was too much reverb, too. It was hard to get past. I don’t even know why I listened to the whole thing. Maybe I just wanted to feel close to him again. Wait, no, I’m not talking about him.<br>
                It sounded like the whole thing was recorded in a closet or something. That is the sort of stuff that he would listen to. These odd indie tracks that he would download from Bandcamp and stuff. None of it was ever as down as this, though. He listened to the same kind of music that I did. No, no, no. I’m not writing about him. I’m writing about the tape.<br>
                The second song was the most upsetting. It was the only one where I heard female vocals, and I almost couldn’t get through it. There was something about it, so full of sadness, and the droning instrumentals only made it worse. It was almost like the song was worming its way into my head. It felt like the exact thing that I’m supposed to be avoiding, so I kept listening. By the time I finished it, I was in tears. <br>
                I think that maybe I shouldn’t listen to it, or maybe I should try writing about it later when I’m less in my head, or maybe that is the point of writing it down, so it's not stuck in my head. Either way, it is late, and I should probably go to bed. <br>Goodnight!<br>

            <p>	I told myself I would write when I felt stuck in my head over all of this, but I haven’t written here in a while. Honestly, ever since I found that tape, I haven’t really wanted to write. I’ve been too busy trying to listen to other music, you know, to drown it out. I’ve had that second track stuck in my head. It’s not even the kind of song that I thought could get stuck in someone’s head. <br>
                I held on long enough without listening to the tape again. I thought that I shouldn’t let the paranoia get to me. Like it would somehow help me get better to avoid anything that reminds me of him. I’ve really been trying. That was until I saw him at the coffee shop we used to go to.<br>
                I thought, what the hell, I’ll try to get back into my habits. I’ve been spending too much of my time locked up in my apartment. I used to go to concerts and coffee shops all the time, so I should try to get back to those happy things like my therapist says. Her advice still makes me angry, but I follow it on the days where I feel a little better.<br>
             I just wanted to get some work done, and there he was sitting at our table in the corner. He looked at me, and there was a glint in his eye, and I thought that maybe he was trying to tell me something. I thought back to the tape. Maybe he had left it there on purpose, so he was trying to tell me something. </p>
