                            <p>January 5, 2013</p>
                            <p>I started listening to my old tapes and records this morning. I’m trying to get back to normal again, I think. I was listening to one of my mixtapes from highschool, you know, as a way to cope. It was chalk full of that 90s riot grrrl I used to listen to. Raincoats, Bikini Kill, Veruca Salt, etc. All of that shit my mom showed me when I was younger. It was nice, listening to angry music like that. It made me feel something other than sad.</p>
                            <p>That was another thing my therapist said, that I should try and do things that make me happy. She thinks it's a good way for me to get out of this ‘funk’ as she calls it. I think it just makes me feel worse. I think the angry music helps, it makes me feel like I’m finally moving on. She says that anger is natural, and it’s all a part of how I ‘heal.’ Her saying that just makes me more angry.</p>
                            <p>When I was flipping through my tapes, there was this weird one that stuck out. It looked new, but it didn’t look like a mixtape. It just had ‘monomania’ scribbled on the side. I recognised the handwriting, of course, and lost my breath for a second. Isn’t that pathetic? Shitty handwriting can make me double over. So much for moving on. I couldn’t help myself from listening, though. </p>
                            <p>The music on the tape was weird, too. It was an entire album. It was some guy whining over these distorted synth and guitar tracks. Some of them were ten or fifteen minutes long! Imagine how much time it takes to write a fifteen minute song, let alone make sure it actually sounds good. Maybe that’s why I’m creeped out by it. The lyrics were mean, too. It was a breakup album. I mean, it wasn’t his voice, so I know he didn’t leave some depressing demo tape in my apartment, but I don’t know why he would have listened to something like that. Was he listening to breakup albums, even before? I actually don’t want to think about that.</p>
                            <p>Back to the tape. Half of the lyrics were just screaming, not even words, just la la la, or woaaah woaaah woaaah. There was too much reverb, too. It was hard to get past. I don’t even know why I listened to the whole thing. Maybe I just wanted to feel close to him again. Wait, no, I’m not talking about him.</p>
                            <p>It sounded like the whole thing was recorded in a closet. That is the sort of stuff that he would listen to. These odd indie tracks that he would download from Bandcamp and stuff. None of it was ever as depressing as this, though. He listened to the same kind of music that I did. No, no, no. I’m not writing about him. I’m writing about the tape.</p>
                            <p>The second song was the most upsetting. It was the only one where I heard female vocals, and I almost couldn’t get through it. There was something about it, so full of sadness, and the droning instrumentals only made it worse. It was almost like the song was worming its way into my head. It felt like the exact thing that I’m supposed to be avoiding, so I kept listening. By the time I finished it, I was in tears.</p>
                            <p>That seems to be a common thing these days.</p>
                            <p>I think that maybe I shouldn’t listen to it, or maybe I should try writing about it later when I’m less in my head, or maybe that is the point of journaling, so it's not stuck in my head. Either way, it’s late, and I should probably go to bed.</p>
                            <p>Goodnight!</p>

                            <p>I told myself I would write here when I felt stuck in my head over all of this, but I haven’t written here in a while. Honestly, ever since I found that tape, I haven’t really wanted to write. I’ve been too busy trying to listen to other music, you know, to drown it out. I’ve had that second track stuck in my head. It’s not even the kind of song that I thought could get stuck in someone’s head.</p>
                            <p>I’ve been trying to get back into the swing of things. I started on a new manuscript, but I can’t say that I’m happy with it. It’s not quite the typical writers’ block that I normally get. It’s like my words are escaping me. The characters and the story are there, but the words aren’t. I thought I would just write somewhere else and just spill all of my thoughts before going back to a big project, so here I am. That seems to work for me, getting all of the gunk out before I try and go back to the big picture stuff.</p>
                            <p>I held on long enough without listening to the tape again. I thought that I shouldn’t let the paranoia get to me. Like it would somehow help me get better to avoid anything that reminds me of him. I’ve really been trying. That was until I saw him at the coffee shop we used to go to.</p>
                            <p>I thought, what the hell, I’ll try to get back into my habits. I’ve been spending too much of my time locked up in my apartment. I used to go to concerts and coffee shops all the time, so I should try to get back to those happy things like my therapist says. Her advice still makes me angry, but I follow it on the days where I feel a little better.</p>
                            <p>I just wanted to get some work done, and there he was sitting at our table in the corner. He looked at me, and there was a glint in his eye, and I thought that maybe he was trying to tell me something. I thought back to the tape. Maybe he had left it there on purpose, so he was trying to tell me something.</p>
                            <p>I went home and listened to it again. It was still grating, with all of that reverb and scratching, but when I got to the second song, and I heard the female vocals, I could have sworn there was something else. Like there was another voice underneath that one.</p>
                            <p>I need to give it more thought. In the meantime, I think I’m going to take another stab at my manuscript.</p>
                            <p>Goodbye!</p>

                        <!-- <h2>Another Blog Post</h2> -->
                        <p>February 5, 2013</p>
                        <p>It’s been a month, and I can’t say that I feel any better. I still have those days where I feel like I can’t get out of bed, and all I can do is cry. Valentine’s day is coming up, and that feels like some sort of cruel joke. I had been planning something since the beginning of January, there was a concert that I had gotten him tickets for. One of those bands we had both liked and bonded over in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>I swear I’ve been trying to not think about him, but I can’t help it. It’s like I’m a child who had their favourite stuffed animal taken away, and all I can do is cry and scream until it's given back. He was more than a stuffed animal, though. I thought I was going to spend my life with him.</p>
                        <p>He took all of his stuff with him when he left, but he left that fucking cassette in my tape deck. When I find myself missing him, I listen to the tape. It feels like the only thing I have left of him. I’m used to filling the silence with music, it helps me think, and this tape seems to make me think more than anything else does.</p>
                        <p>I think I’m finally starting to understand the appeal of this sort of music. There are only so many ways to represent emotion through art, and this feels like it came straight from the musician’s soul. It feels like the music meanders and screams in time with the emotions that he’s singing about. I’ve transcribed the lyrics to the second song below:</p>
                        <p>Everything you say is a bridge
                        Everything you do is water under it
                        These were not the original lyrics
                        Such a worthless waste of time to write it down
                        
                        Every bit of you that I don’t love
                        Is filled up with my hate
                        I was a situation that you were glad went away
                        
                        You move forward like a human being
                        Sometimes you have to kill things to impress your friends
                        You probably look like an idiot in that hat
                        Used to feel bad about crushing hands
                        
                        I can’t go back to not understanding what you mean to me
                        I’m turning into the person that you were afraid I’d turn out to be
                        
                        There is something in me that can only give
                        There is something in you that can only give out
                        
                        (female vocals)
                        When you hear my songs, do you get that feeling?
                        And if not, what the hell were you hearing?
                        
                        (male vocals)
                        I am not crazy, I am right
                        What do you mean? What are you saying to me?
                        I was just another bird you touched
                        Whose mother wouldn’t take him back
                        
                        (female vocals)
                        I’m sorry I misheard your lyrics
                        (male vocals)
                        Tried to smile but it didn’t show up in the photograph
                        (female vocals)
                        I was searching for a soul to sell my devils to
                        (male vocals)
                        All I wanted was sleep and you took it away
                        
                        Did you do something wrong? Was there something you did that I could blame?
                        Thought I was open, thought I was intimate, and then you asked me my name
                        
                        By the time they send the lifeboats
                        I won’t want to leave the island
                        Calling out to distant shorelines
                        Calling out for different baselines
                        
                        (various aaahs)
                        
                        I can’t go back to not understanding what you mean to me
                        I’m turning into the person that you were afraid I’d turn out to be
                        Did you do something wrong? Was there something you did that I could blame?
                        Thought I was open, thought I was intimate, and then you asked me my name
                        
                        (male and female vocals)
                        It was nothing special
                        It was nothing sacred
                        Just hands held
                        And shoulders rubbed
                        And voices touched
                        In holy harmony
                        
                        ***</p>
                        
                        <p>I’ve decided that he left the tape intentionally. He had to have.</p>
